This repository represents our project file for CS-554 Web Programming II Final Project Submission.
For our final project, we have decided to create a very simple online multiplayer game. We want to take our knowledge of web development to the next level by implementing something beyond a simple webpage with account functionality. By using various technologies taught in class, we will be able to build a basic online game with user accounts and real-time interactions between players.
Our game will be a simple 2D multiplayer co-op game where users work together to defeat enemies in a dungeon-type setting. Players will be able to progress independently or as part of a team, and track their progress in defeating several types of enemies. This progress will be linked to their user account and persist through multiple play sessions.
