This repository represents our project file for CS-554 Web Programming II Final Project Submission.
For our final project, we have decided to create a very simple online multiplayer game. We want to take our knowledge of web development to the next level by implementing something beyond a simple webpage with account functionality. By using various technologies taught in class, we will be able to build a basic online game with user accounts and real-time interactions between players.

Our game will be a simple 2D multiplayer co-op game where users work together to defeat enemies in a dungeon-type setting. Players will be able to progress independently or as part of a team, and track their progress in defeating several types of enemies. This progress will be linked to their user account and persist through multiple play sessions.

# Quick Start

To simply play the game:

1. Make sure you have Redis, Erlang, and Node installed and functioning.
2. Start the Redis service on your system
3. Start the game server by navigating to the `server` directory and running `make run`
4. Copy the .env file into the `frontend` directory
5. Install front-end dependencies by running `npm i` in the `frontend` directory
6. Start the game with `npm start` in the `frontend` directory, login or sign up and play!
